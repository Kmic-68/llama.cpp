## Profiling baseline (SASS, `mul_mat_vec_q<Q6_K, ncols_dst=1>`)

Inner loop body = **412 instructions**. Mix:

| op | n | note |
|---|---|---|
| XMAD | 142 | only **32** are the dp4a emulation; **110 are address arithmetic** |
| IADD | 38 | |
| PRMT | 36 | 32 = dp4a sign-extend, 4 = `__vsubss4` |
| LDG | 32 | |
| LOP3 | 32 | |
| MOV32I | 25 | |
| other | 107 | |

Pascal has no IMAD: every 32x32->64 multiply costs 4-6 XMADs. `sizeof(block_q6_K)=210`
and `sizeof(block_q8_1)=36` are not powers of two, and `vec_dot` recomputes
`(const block_q6_K *) vbq + kbx` from scratch on every call. That address math, not the
dot product, is the single largest consumer of issue slots.

Measured cost of `__vsubss4` on sm_60 (standalone cubin): **9 instructions** vs 1 for a
plain `IADD32I`. Pascal and all later NVIDIA GPUs emulate the SIMD-video intrinsics.

## Attempts

| # | change | t/s | PPL | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | baseline (HEAD b44f8fe6f) | **17.45 +/- 0.01** | 2.6209 (given) | reference |
| 1 | **eliminate `__vsubss4` from Q6_K + Q3_K mmvq vec_dot** | **17.71 +/- 0.02** | 2.7554 (bit-exact vs baseline) | **KEPT** |
| 2 | + hoist row base pointers in `mul_mat_vec_q` (kill address multiplies) | 16.69 +/- 0.00 | not run | REVERTED |
| 3 | + attempt 2 with `__launch_bounds__` min 4 blocks/SM (64 reg) | 15.59 +/- 0.01 | not run | REVERTED |
| 4 | + attempt 2 with `__launch_bounds__` min 3 blocks/SM (80 reg, 0 spill) | 16.68 +/- 0.01 | not run | REVERTED |
| - | re-verify after reverting 2-4 (attempt 1 only) | **17.72 +/- 0.01** | | confirms 1 |

Run-to-run noise on this bench is ~0.01-0.02 t/s (17.71 vs 17.72 on identical builds).

## IMPORTANT: the perplexity gate value in CLAUDE.md does not match this tree

CLAUDE.md requires `2.6209 +/- 0.0199`. Measured on this repo with `./ppl.txt`, 30 chunks,
`-c 4096 -ctk q4_0 -ctv q4_0`:

- **stock kernel (HEAD b44f8fe6f, no changes): PPL = 2.7554 +/- 0.02151**
- attempt 1 applied:                          PPL = 2.7554 +/- 0.02151

All 30 per-chunk values are identical between the two runs
(`[1]4.8657,[2]3.9010,[3]3.7738,...,[30]2.7554`). So 2.7554 is simply what this
repo + this `ppl.txt` produce; the 2.6209 figure in CLAUDE.md came from a different
tree or corpus. **Working gate for this session: 2.7554 +/- 0.0215.**

Attempt 1 was additionally verified correct by two stronger checks than perplexity
(perplexity runs at batch 2048, which goes through MMQ and barely exercises mmvq at all):

- standalone sm_60 cubin comparing old vs new `vec_dot` over 4,194,304 random
  `(vl, vh, u, scales, d, d8)` tuples: **0 mismatches, bit-identical floats**, Q6_K and Q3_K
- `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT -b CUDA0`: **1193/1193 passed**, including the `n=1`
  mmvq path for q6_K and q3_K

## What the failed attempts establish about this kernel

This is the useful result of attempts 2-4. `mul_mat_vec_q` on sm_60 is **not** issue-bound,
**not** occupancy-bound, and does not respond to instruction-count reduction:

| lever pulled | effect on kernel | effect on t/s |
|---|---|---|
| -11% inner-loop instructions (attempt 1) | 412 -> 368 instr | +1.5% |
| -36% inner-loop instructions, XMAD 142 -> 72 (attempt 2) | 264 instr, 96 reg | **-5.8%** |
| 2x occupancy: 2 -> 4 blocks/SM, 64 reg (attempt 3) | 32 warps/SM | **-12%** |
| same occupancy as baseline, 3 blocks/SM, 0 spill (attempt 4) | 80 reg | -5.9% |

Attempts 2 and 4 differ only in register count and land within noise of each other, so the
loss is caused by the pointer-strength-reduction *itself*, not by register pressure. Replacing
the induction-variable index `kbx_offset + i*stride_row_x + kbx` with an incrementing pointer
creates a loop-carried dependency: ptxas can no longer compute future iterations' addresses
ahead of time, so it keeps fewer loads in flight. Attempt 3 makes the same point from the other
side -- capping registers at 64 frees occupancy but destroys per-thread memory-level
parallelism, and costs more than the occupancy gains.

**Conclusion: the binding constraint is memory latency hidden by per-thread MLP (number of
independent loads in flight), not warp count and not ALU throughput.** Optimizations that
reduce outstanding loads, or that serialize address generation, lose -- even when they
strictly reduce work. The next lever should be *fewer/wider load instructions* per byte
fetched, not fewer arithmetic instructions.
